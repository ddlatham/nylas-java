# Nylas Java SDK
This is the GitHub repository for the Nylas Java SDK and this repo is primarily for anyone who wants to make contributions to the SDK or install it from source. If you are looking to use Java to access the Nylas Email, Calendar, or Contacts API you should refer to our official [Java SDK Quickstart Guide](https://docs.nylas.com/docs/quickstart-java).

The Nylas Communications Platform provides REST APIs for [Email](https://docs.nylas.com/docs/quickstart-email), [Calendar](https://docs.nylas.com/docs/quickstart-calendar), and [Contacts](https://docs.nylas.com/docs/quickstart-contacts), and the Java SDK is the quickest way to build your integration using Java.
