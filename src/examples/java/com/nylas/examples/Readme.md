If you're new here, please take a look at our [Java SDK quickstart guide](https://docs.nylas.com/docs/quickstart-java), it's the best resource to learn how to get up and running.

## How to Run the Examples
Clone this repo to your machine

`git clone https://github.com/nylas/nylas-java.git && cd nylas-java`

Create an example.properties file from the [provided template](https://github.com/nylas/nylas-java/blob/master/src/examples/resources/example.properties.template), and modify the file to include the values you need for the examples you want to run. At the very least, you need to set `nylas.client.id` and `nylas.client.secret` to match your Nylas App.

`cp src/examples/resources/example.properties.template src/examples/resources/example.properties`	

	
Here is an example of how to run the Hosted Authentication example:

`./gradlew runExample -Pexample=com.nylas.examples.hostedAuth.HostedAuthUrlExample` 

Replace `hostedAuth.HostedAuthUrlExample` with any of the examples found in the subdirectories here.
